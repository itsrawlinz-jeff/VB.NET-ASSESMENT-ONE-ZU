A program is required that prompts the user to enter a point (x, y) and checks 
whether the point is within the circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 10. For 
example, (4, 5) is inside the circle and (9, 9) is outside the circle. (Hint: A point is 
in the circle if the distance between the point (x, y) and center of circle is less than 
or equal to radius. The formula for computing the distance is.

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health based on height and weight. It can 
be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing it by the square of 
your height in meters. The interpretation of BMI for people 20 years or older is as 
follows:
BMI Interpretation
BMI < 18.5 Underweight
18.5 ≤ BMI < 25.0 Normal
25.0 ≤ BMI < 30.0 Overweight
30.0 ≤ BMI Obese
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and height in inches 
and displays the BMI. Note that one pound is 0.45359237 kilograms and one inch 
is0.0254 meters
